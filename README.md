# Implementation of a relational database property management company using structured SQL
The aim of the work was to create a relational database that would simulate the basic operation of systems
databases managing data collected by enterprises and real estate offices. Database
allows you to perform all the most important operations performed on this type of objects,
including the section on methods performed:
- due to the type of link between the entity and the database management system (differentiates between the administrator, database manager and the client or persons with a lower degree of
permissions)
- due to the type of command we execute (distinguishes obtaining information
from a specific table from modifying sensitive data).
